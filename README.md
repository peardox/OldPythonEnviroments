# OldPythonEnviroments

This is a slightly out of date version of the real[ PythonEnviroments Repo](https://github.com/Embarcadero/PythonEnviroments) that will compile fine under Delphi 10.4.x - it has a few known problems (with Android) and uses older versions of Python. This is provides as a stop-gap measure for people who want to play with the Python for Delphi Suite while we address the non-10.4.x issue

Components to simplify the deployment for Python environments for Delphi applications using [Python4Delphi](https://github.com/Embarcadero/Python4Delphi).

This powers the [Delphi Data Sciences Libraries](https://github.com/Embarcadero/P4D-Data-Sciences).

This is an early access preview, but you are encouraged to try it out, file bug reports, and add features. [Read more](https://blogs.embarcadero.com/?p=145025) and catch the live stream.
